# Solution
Now we have a unity game.

In the game, if we modify our wallet balance by setting the first value as 0 in cheat engine search and then withdrawing 696 money from bank and then searching for 696 in cheat engine, we get the address of the wallet value. Modifying the wallet value to 999999 we can get wisdom from the person.

From that we get the hint that it has something to do with decompiling the game and looking at artifacts. After decompiling the games with AssetRipper and viewing the flag audio in spectogram we get the flag.
